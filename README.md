# Self-Driving-car using Udacity Simulator 
**Behavioral Cloning technique is applied to run the car on autonomous mode.Model used is modified Nvidia model with 
5 convolution layers. Then it is flatten to be input to fully connected layers.Activation function used is _elu_.Learning
rate is set to 10^-4 to get better results.Different data augmentations techniques have been applied in bathes to create 
more datasets. Still the work is on as car is deviating from the track.Any recommendations are WELCOME.**
